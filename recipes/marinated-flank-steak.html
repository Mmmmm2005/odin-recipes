<h3>Make the best steak of your life with this top-rated recipe. A complex, savory flank steak marinade ensures perfectly tender and juicy beef every time.</h3>

<p>
    Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.
